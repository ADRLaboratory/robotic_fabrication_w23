# Introduction

Welcome to the W23 semester course code documentation for ARCH 509 Robotic Fabrication! This course is taught by [Prof. Arash Adel] at the Univeristy of Michigan, Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning.[^1]

## Course Description

*Robotic Fabrication* discusses the application of industrial robotic arms in architecture and construction. In particular, this course focuses on the coupling of custom computational design methods with nonstandard robotic fabrication and assembly routines. It illustrates that this integrated process can result in a paradigm shift, a bidirectional design ontology that fosters novel tectonic repertoires, performance measures, and expressive opportunities.

The main topics covered in this course include robotics fundamentals (such as coordinate frames, transformations, robot models, inverse, and forward kinematics), introduction to industrial robotic arms, main robot components, workspace, robot control, task and motion planning, custom tool design, digital design-to-fabrication workflows, and fabrication procedures for building-scale construction.

The state-of-the-art robotic fabrication facilities at Taubman College provide the necessary infrastructure for this course. Students will initially work with a KUKA KR AGILUS robotic arm to learn the fundamentals. Subsequently, they will work with two KUKA KR 60 robotic arms to fabricate building-scale sub-assemblies. These sub-assemblies will help explore the architectural potentials of robotic fabrication technologies and provide the means to rethink architectural production by implementing seamless digital design-to-fabrication chains.

This course is structured around the following main activities: lectures by the instructor, selected readings, hands-on workshops, weekly assignments, a midterm, and a final project.

## Documentation
